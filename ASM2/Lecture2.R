##check the PH assumption using hypothesis testing 

cox.zph(m1)

##results suggest to reject the null hypothesis of proportionality of hazard (PH)

##PH assumption could be also assessed by visual check and evaluating than HR is constant over time

plot(cox.zph(m1))

##if the PH assumption is not met we could adapt a Cox model considering the intercation between the covariate and a function of time
##just consider the model with the interaction term between clinic and survival time (different function forms could be considered for time in the interaction)
##before interpreting coefficients in the model that is not straightforward check if PH assumption is met

cox.zph(coxph(Surv(survt, status) ~ clinic*survt, data = addicts))
##considering the interaction the PH assumption is not violated (!!!considering we are including in the model and effect for clinic that depends on time!!)


##fit the Cox model focusing on assessing the effect of prison and evaluate the PH assumption

##evaluate the additive and the multiplicative model as general steps to be considered in model development to chech significance of the model and model assumptions
